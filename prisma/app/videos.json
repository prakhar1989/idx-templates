this? Users can try out your app without having to sign in, but they still have a unique ID that you can use to store their data. Once they are sure they like your app, you can ask them to sign in, and upgrade their guest account to a full account.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Asking users to sign in first 😱\n0:44 How to build a streamlined onboarding process\n0:59 Reasons for signing in\n2:17 The sample app\n2:47 DEMO: No need to sign in!\n3:30 How does this work?\n5:51 Implementing Anonymous Authentication\n7:56 Upgrading accounts using Account Linking\n9:59 DEMO: Anonymous Auth & Account Linking in action\n12:31 Other scenarios\n\nResources:\nGetting started with Firebase Auth for Apple platforms → https://goo.gle/3DDIlbk \nAnonymous Authentication for Apple documentation → https://goo.gle/2wLa36H \nFirebase Console → https://goo.gle/3vPYq9K \nGetting started with Firebase on Apple platforms → https://goo.gle/3szkx2j \nApp Store Review Guidelines → https://goo.gle/3SLjxmm  \nSource code → https://goo.gle/3Gnabtn \n\nCatch more Firebase Fundamentals → https://goo.gle/Firebase-Fundamentals \nSubscribe to Firebase → https://goo.gle/Firebase \n\n#FirebaseFundamentals","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6jGNSFdHHXc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6jGNSFdHHXc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6jGNSFdHHXc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6jGNSFdHHXc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6jGNSFdHHXc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Firebase","playlistId":"UUP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","position":183,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"6jGNSFdHHXc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Firebase","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","statistics":{"viewCount":12878,"likeCount":208,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":19}},{"publishedAt":"2023-04-06T13:00:37Z","channelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","title":"First look: Use OR conditions in Firestore queries","description":"Firebase Shorts → https://goo.gle/FirebaseShorts \nSubscribe to Firebase → https://goo.gle/Firebase  \n\n#FirebaseShorts","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/peS8pbWpPrE/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/peS8pbWpPrE/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/peS8pbWpPrE/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/peS8pbWpPrE/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/peS8pbWpPrE/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Firebase","playlistId":"UUP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","position":184,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"peS8pbWpPrE"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Firebase","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","statistics":{"viewCount":3901,"likeCount":150,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":10}},{"publishedAt":"2023-03-29T16:23:35Z","channelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","title":"Firebase Realtime Database updates with Kotlin Flows in Android #Shorts","description":"Firebase Shorts → https://goo.gle/FirebaseShorts \nSubscribe to Firebase → https://goo.gle/Firebase  \n\n#FirebaseShorts","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-R0gBGxLfw4/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-R0gBGxLfw4/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-R0gBGxLfw4/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-R0gBGxLfw4/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-R0gBGxLfw4/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Firebase","playlistId":"UUP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","position":185,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"-R0gBGxLfw4"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Firebase","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","statistics":{"viewCount":3371,"likeCount":96,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":3}},{"publishedAt":"2023-03-28T13:00:40Z","channelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","title":"Mar 2023: Top takeaways from Google for Games Developer Summit, Firestore OR queries, and Terraform","description":"Welcome to the March 2023 edition of Firebase Release Notes with Frank van Puffelen.

As you rely more on Firebase for the advanced features of your app, it remains equally important to stay up to date with data protection regulations such as the GDPR, and to protect the privacy of your users. In this talk, you'll see  how you can use Firebase to create an experience that pleases both your users and your data stewardship team.\n\nIt’s important to delete user data when you no longer need it. FriendlyPix uses a Cloud Function to periodically delete old data that you can use as a model https://link.firebase.events/h1 \n\nIt’s a bit tricky to set up Cloud Functions that run periodically rather than being triggered by an action. Use this post as a guide https://link.firebase.events/h2\n\nOne of the best ways to manage user data in a Serverless app is to trigger Cloud Function onAuthentication events. Check out our guide https://link.firebase.events/h3 for how to do this.\n\nWe created a guide https://link.firebase.events/h4  to help you write functions that clear and export user data.\n\nSecurity Rules Emulators https://link.firebase.events/h5  let you write tests against your security rules and run them locally or as part of Continuous Integration.\n\nIt’s important to understand the retention policies for each Firebase Service and that’s available in our Privacy and Security Terms https://link.firebase.events/h6\n\nGoogle Cloud recently published a whitepaper https://link.firebase.events/h7 describing what happens on Google Cloud Platform when a developer deletes an object.\n\nInstance IDs are the way Firebase keeps track of app instances. When a user deletes their account, it’s up to you to delete their Instance ID. Learn more in our guide to managing instance IDs https://link.firebase.events/h8 \n\nIf you want to track changes to privacy preferences in your app, this sample of a Cloud Function https://link.firebase.events/h9 listens for changes to privacy preferences, and then writes changes to an immutable activity log.\n\nOur guide to storing privacy preferences https://link.firebase.events/h10 has useful tips for gathering user preferences, storing them, logging changes, and writing Security Rules to make sure preferences are secure.\n\nView the schedule → https://g.co/firebase/summit\n\nAll Sessions playlist → http://bit.ly/FirebaseSummit18\nSubscribe to the Firebase YouTube channel! → http://bit.ly/firebase2\n\nPresented by: Sebastian Schmidt and Rachel Myers\n\nGive us your feedback in the comments below and help shape the future of Firebase.\n\n\nEvent photos → https://fs18.page.link/photos\nMusic by Terra Monk → http://bit.ly/2Q0msYH\n\n#FirebaseSummit event: Firebase Summit 2018; re_ty: Publish; product: Firebase - Security Rules, Firebase - Cloud Functions; fullname: Rachel Myers;","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nhgWEXkbn4A/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nhgWEXkbn4A/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nhgWEXkbn4A/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nhgWEXkbn4A/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nhgWEXkbn4A/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Firebase","playlistId":"UUP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","position":527,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"nhgWEXkbn4A"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Firebase","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","statistics":{"viewCount":4369,"likeCount":81,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":5}},{"publishedAt":"2018-10-29T18:52:45Z","channelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","title":"Firebase Summit 2018 Livestream","description":"Firebase Summit 2018\nCubex Centrum Praha  |  Prague, Czech Republic\nOctober 29, 2018  |  10 AM to 6 PM (CET)\n\nFirebase is Google’s mobile development platform that helps your team across the app lifecycle - from building your app, to improving quality, to growing your business.

In this video with Thomas Bouldin and Lauren Long, learn how to improve your development process and prevent bugs before your code gets into production by writing functions in TypeScript, using our new tools for unit testing, and experimenting with your functions locally using the emulator.\n\nCheck out the rest of the Firebase Dev Summit videos here: https://goo.gl/bczYSW\nSubscribe to the Firebase Channel and never miss Firebase updates: https://goo.gl/9giPHG event: Firebase Summit 2017; re_ty: Publish;","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tResEeK6P5I/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tResEeK6P5I/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tResEeK6P5I/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tResEeK6P5I/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tResEeK6P5I/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Firebase","playlistId":"UUP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","position":641,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"tResEeK6P5I"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Firebase","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","statistics":{"viewCount":46740,"likeCount":553,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":35}},{"publishedAt":"2017-10-31T17:29:42Z","channelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","title":"Building Quality Apps with Crashlytics & Firebase Performance (Firebase Dev Summit 2017)","description":"App quality is paramount for app success, and poor app quality can lead to frustrated users and low retention.

It's the radio but better; reaching those with a device in their pockets at all times. Some of the biggest challenges in any mobile app are that first impression. When the user first installs the app developers have a very limited amount of time to convince them to keep the app and get engaged in the experience. With Firebase Dynamic Links, NPR One was able to shorten the amount of interactions it takes to get from promoted content to content inside the installed app.\n\nFirebase Dynamic Links allows developers to do things that the internet hasn’t solved: creating playlists of content that are configured by the podcaster or by a member station or by us internally and wrapping all that in a one-click listening experience. In addition, having Firebase Analytics interact with things like Dynamic Links, Remote Configuration, Cloud Messaging, adds a multiplier effect. \n\nFinally, integration with the broader Firebase suite means developers don't have to go outside the platform to figure out what’s working. So it’s not just about shipping the product, the feature enhancement faster, it’s about analyzing the results faster.\n\nMike Seiffalahi is the the lead mobile developer for NPR Digital Media. Nick DePrey, is the innovation accountant at NPR. Tejas Mistry is the Senior Product Manager of NPR One.\n\nSubscribe to the new Firebase Channel: https://goo.gl/9giPHG","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xyOVMlWh33g/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xyOVMlWh33g/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xyOVMlWh33g/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xyOVMlWh33g/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xyOVMlWh33g/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Firebase","playlistId":"UUP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","position":790,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"xyOVMlWh33g"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Firebase","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","statistics":{"viewCount":9666,"likeCount":81,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":1}},{"publishedAt":"2016-08-24T17:39:55Z","channelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","title":"What makes Firebase Analytics unique? - #AskFirebase","description":"Ask the Firebase team your Firebase questions.

Recent data from the Google Play Store revealed that the majority of users will never open an app again if they encounter two early-stage crashes. They are also more likely to give it a low rating and write a bad review. By mining the data from the 1-star reviews on Play, we recognized that more than half of these reviews are related to quality issues.\n\nIn this talk, we provide Google’s guidelines to building and publishing higher quality apps. We walk you through various tools and suites that allow you to ensure higher quality for your applications throughout the development lifecycle.\n\nWatch more Firebase talks at I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/JTH9Fr \nSee all the talks from Google I/O 2016 here: https://goo.gl/olw6kV\nSubscribe to the brand new Firebase Channel: https://goo.gl/9giPHG \n\nGet started using Firebase today https://goo.gl/gCHr6r\n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016 #Firebase -\n\nGet started using Firebase today https://goo.gl/gCHr6r\n\n#io16 #GoogleIO #GoogleIO2016 #Firebase","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4fyhgHQYG1U/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4fyhgHQYG1U/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4fyhgHQYG1U/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4fyhgHQYG1U/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4fyhgHQYG1U/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Firebase","playlistId":"UUP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","position":828,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"4fyhgHQYG1U"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Firebase","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","statistics":{"viewCount":4205,"likeCount":29,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":1}},{"publishedAt":"2016-05-19T19:20:52Z","channelId":"UCP4bf6IHJJQehibu6ai__cg","title":"Google Cloud Messaging performance factors - Google I/O 2016","description":"Explore factors affecting GCM performance while examining our real world performance statistics.

Since all fetches need to happen through the service worker, the browser has to wait for the service worker to start up and run to know what content to load.\n\nWith the Service Workers Static Routing API, at install time, you can declare paths to always be served from the network. When a controlled URL is later loaded, the browser can start fetching resources from those paths before the service worker has finished starting. This removes the service worker from the paths that you know don't need a service worker. \n\n\nSpeaker: Adriana Jara","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_oKxXQzdbY/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_oKxXQzdbY/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_oKxXQzdbY/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_oKxXQzdbY/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d_oKxXQzdbY/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Chrome for Developers","playlistId":"UUnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","position":79,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"d_oKxXQzdbY"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Chrome for Developers","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","statistics":{"viewCount":5233,"likeCount":248,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":2}},{"publishedAt":"2024-03-28T19:02:16Z","channelId":"UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","title":"How to find an INP issue with Chrome DevTools","description":"When you know you have an Interaction to Next Paint (INP) problem but only have a page URL as a starting point, you can use the DevTools Performance panel to identify the issue.

Currently, Chrome shows the PWA install prompts whenever a site has a manifest.json with the correct fields filled in, a secure domain and icons, and a service worker with a fetch handler, with the expectation that such a site will work offline. However, some PWAs can show the install prompts although they do not support offline pages by installing an empty fetch event handler in a service worker. This leads to unexpected behavior for users such as showing the dinosaur page which tells no internet connection. Chrome proposes changing the logic to raise the bar to show the prompts. Concretely, Chrome will actually invoke a fetch event handler with a fake request to see if the handler returns a response with 200 status code, which is a strong signal that the site actually supports the offline capability. The PWA install prompts show up only when a site has a fetch event handler which returns a response with 200 status code.\n\nThis new logic is not available yet. Chrome will run experiments to see how many websites are affected and make sure that the new logic will not cause an unacceptable delay to the page loading time. Chrome will ship the feature after sufficient announcements have been made.\n\nResources:\nNew logic to detect offline support in PWAs → https://goo.gle/improved-pwa-offline-detection\nLet us know what you think of these changes → https://goo.gle/pwa-offline-feedback\nChromium tracking bug → https://goo.gle/3pZIAEL\n\nSpeaker: Asami Doi\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers here → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\nWatch all Chrome Developer Summit sessions here → https://goo.gle/cds20-sessions\n\n#chromedevsummit #chrome #pwa\n\nevent: Chrome Dev Summit 2020; re_ty: Publish; product: Chrome - General; fullname: Asami Doi;","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hoEE39yB2Pg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hoEE39yB2Pg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hoEE39yB2Pg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hoEE39yB2Pg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hoEE39yB2Pg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Chrome for Developers","playlistId":"UUnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","position":576,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"hoEE39yB2Pg"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Chrome for Developers","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","statistics":{"viewCount":22138,"likeCount":488,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":40}},{"publishedAt":"2020-12-18T17:00:17Z","channelId":"UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","title":"Next-level web apps on desktop","description":"The web is the best way to reach the maximum number of users with your application.

While in 2003, progressive enhancement was about using at the time modern CSS features, unobtrusive JavaScript, and even Scalable Vector Graphics, progressive enhancement in 2020 is about using modern browser capabilities.\n\nIn this talk, we show an example of a greeting card web application how new and upcoming browser capabilities can progressively enhance this application so that it remains useful on all modern browsers, but delivers an advanced experience on browsers that support capabilities like native file system access, system clipboard access, contacts retrieval, periodic background sync, screen wake lock, sharing features, and many more.\n\nAfter watching this session, developers will have a solid understanding of how to progressively enhance their web applications with new browser features, all while not putting a download burden on the subset of their users that happen to be on incompatible browsers, and, most importantly, while not excluding them from using the web application in the first place.\n\nResources:\nFugu greetings on GitHub → https://goo.gle/2VkuwYM \nNew capabilities status → https://goo.gle/3dEcyH2 \nVideo write-up → https://web.dev/progressively-enhance-your-pwa/\n\nRelated Playlist:\nDay 2 → https://goo.gle/WDL20Day2\n\nSubscribe to the Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nSpeaker:\nThomas Steiner \n\n#webdevLIVE\" event: web.dev LIVE 2020; re_ty: Publish; fullname: Thomas Steiner; product: Chrome - General;","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NXCT3htg9nk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NXCT3htg9nk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NXCT3htg9nk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NXCT3htg9nk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NXCT3htg9nk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Chrome for Developers","playlistId":"UUnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","position":649,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"NXCT3htg9nk"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Chrome for Developers","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","statistics":{"viewCount":8014,"likeCount":192,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":10}},{"publishedAt":"2020-07-14T19:00:00Z","channelId":"UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","title":"New in Chrome 84: App Shortcuts, Web Animations, Wake Lock, and lots more!","description":"Chrome 84 is rolling out now!

'aside', 'article', and their friends seemed so disconnected from the problems I was solving every day. I had no problem with them, I just didn’t need them.\n\nSince then, I have held onto the core belief that HTML shouldn’t be finished.

Spam and fraud prevention, web-wide measurement, and even ad personalization are all important to a flourishing web — and with cutting-edge cryptographic and ML techniques, we can support those while protecting user privacy and fighting fingerprinting.\n\nPresented by: Emily Stark, Michael Kleber\n\nView the schedule → https://goo.gle/2nON8mp\n\n#ChromeDevSummit All Sessions → https://goo.gle/CDS19\n\nSubscribe to Google Chrome Developers → https://goo.gle/ChromeDevs\n\nEvent photos →  https://goo.gle/CDS19Photos\n\nevent: Chrome Dev Summit 2019; re_ty: Publish; product: Chrome - General; fullname: Michael Kleber;","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WnCKlNE52tc/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WnCKlNE52tc/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WnCKlNE52tc/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WnCKlNE52tc/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WnCKlNE52tc/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Chrome for Developers","playlistId":"UUnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","position":768,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"WnCKlNE52tc"},"videoOwnerChannelTitle":"Chrome for Developers","videoOwnerChannelId":"UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","statistics":{"viewCount":22846,"likeCount":268,"favoriteCount":0,"commentCount":15}},{"publishedAt":"2019-11-11T23:36:52Z","channelId":"UCnUYZLuoy1rq1aVMwx4aTzw","title":"Keynote (Chrome Dev Summit 2019)","description":"The Web is an ecosystem with diversity galore: Web standards, multiple browsers, a huge number and variety of devices, and a plethora of tools and services available.
