# Mysql

A simple mysql starter with NodeJS in Project IDX.

> NOTE: You might have to reload the window once the dependencies are installed for the SQLConnection extension to work as expected

## Next steps

1. Use index.js to see usage
2. Open terminal and connect to the DB using `mysql` and run queries
3. Or use the SQL connection extension from the side panel to query the DB using the UI
